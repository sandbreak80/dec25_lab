Clean up project - remove duplicate instructions and sync docs with deployment

## Documentation Updates
- ✅ Rewrote START_HERE.md - clear 8-step deployment guide matching Team 2 build
- ✅ Rewrote LAB_GUIDE.md - comprehensive guide with all phases and troubleshooting
- ✅ Rewrote QUICK_REFERENCE.md - command reference for quick access
- ✅ Deleted TEAM2_BUILD.md - duplicate content, now in main docs
- ✅ All docs now use Team 1 as example (generic, not Team 2 specific)
- ✅ Consistent workflow across all documentation

## Script Output Cleanup
- ✅ Removed "Next Steps" from lab-deploy.sh (duplicated docs)
- ✅ Removed "Next Steps" from appd-change-password.sh
- ✅ Removed "Next Steps" from appd-bootstrap-vms.sh
- ✅ Removed "Next Steps" from appd-create-cluster.sh
- ✅ Removed "Next Steps" from appd-configure.sh
- ✅ Removed "Next Steps" from appd-install.sh
- ✅ Removed "Next Steps" from appd-install-secureapp.sh

**Rationale:** Scripts should execute cleanly without repeating what's 
already documented. Students follow docs (START_HERE.md or LAB_GUIDE.md), 
not script output. This reduces cognitive load and prevents confusion.

## Project Organization
- ✅ Removed Team 2 specific documentation (TEAM2_BUILD.md)
- ✅ State files remain for Team 2 (actual deployment)
- ✅ Lab/ directory contains legacy/development history (preserved)
- ✅ Root-level scripts are production scripts
- ✅ Root-level docs are student-facing

## Documentation Consistency
All docs now follow this workflow (matching actual Team 2 deployment):
1. Deploy infrastructure (lab-deploy.sh)
2. Change password (appd-change-password.sh)
3. Setup SSH keys (scripts/setup-ssh-keys.sh) - RECOMMENDED
4. Bootstrap VMs (appd-bootstrap-vms.sh) + WAIT 15-20 min
5. Create cluster (appd-create-cluster.sh)
6. Configure (appd-configure.sh)
7. Install (appd-install.sh)
8. Verify (appd-check-health.sh)

## User Experience Improvements
- ✅ Single source of truth: START_HERE.md for quick start
- ✅ Detailed reference: LAB_GUIDE.md for comprehensive guide
- ✅ Quick commands: QUICK_REFERENCE.md for copy/paste
- ✅ No duplicate instructions between scripts and docs
- ✅ Cleaner script output focuses on status, not instructions
- ✅ All examples use Team 1 (generic) not Team 2 (specific)

Students now have:
- Clear entry point (START_HERE.md)
- Detailed guidance when needed (LAB_GUIDE.md)
- Quick reference for common tasks (QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
- Clean script output without clutter
