# 🚀 START HERE - AppDynamics Lab Quick Start

**Deploy your AppDynamics cluster in ~60 minutes**

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (For Students)

### Step 1: Get AWS Credentials

Your instructor will provide you with:
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key
- Team number (1-5)

### Step 2: Configure AWS CLI

```bash
# Install AWS CLI (if needed)
# macOS:
brew install awscli

# Linux:
sudo apt install awscli

# Configure credentials
aws configure

# Enter when prompted:
AWS Access Key ID: [from instructor]
AWS Secret Access Key: [from instructor]
Default region name: us-west-2
Default output format: json
```

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

```bash
# Test AWS authentication
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Should show:
{
  "Account": "314839308236",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::314839308236:user/lab-student"
}
```

✅ **If you see this, you're ready!**

### Step 4: Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandbreak80/dec25_lab.git
cd dec25_lab
```

### Step 5: Deploy Your Lab

```bash
# Replace N with your team number (1-5)
./deployment/01-deploy.sh --team N
```

**This will automatically:**
- ✅ Create your VPC and networking
- ✅ Launch 3 EC2 instances
- ✅ Configure load balancer and SSL
- ✅ Set up DNS records
- ✅ Bootstrap all VMs
- ✅ Create Kubernetes cluster
- ✅ Install AppDynamics (Controller, EUM, Events, AIOps, SecureApp)

**Total time:** ~60 minutes

---

## 📊 What You'll Get

After deployment completes:

### Your Controller
- **URL:** `https://controller-teamN.splunkylabs.com/controller/`
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `welcome`
- **⚠️ Change password immediately after first login!**

### Your Infrastructure
- 3× EC2 instances (m5a.4xlarge: 16 vCPU, 64GB RAM each)
- Load balancer with SSL certificate
- DNS: `teamN.splunkylabs.com`
- Isolated VPC with security groups

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### ❌ "Unable to locate credentials"

**Problem:** AWS CLI not configured

**Fix:**
```bash
aws configure
# Re-enter your credentials
```

### ❌ Script exits silently with no error

**Problem:** Wrong AWS profile or permission issue

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify authentication
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Check you're using default profile
echo $AWS_PROFILE
# Should be empty or "default"

# If not empty, unset it
unset AWS_PROFILE
```

### ❌ "An error occurred (UnauthorizedOperation)"

**Problem:** IAM permissions insufficient

**Fix:**
1. Verify your credentials are correct
2. Contact instructor (you may need updated IAM policy)
3. Test permissions:
```bash
./scripts/test-aws-cli.sh
```

### ❌ "SSH timeout" or "Connection refused"

**Problem:** Not connected to VPN

**Fix:**
1. Connect to VPN
2. Verify: `curl https://ifconfig.me`
3. Retry deployment

### ❌ "MySQL database is locked" error

**Problem:** Race condition during installation (FIXED)

**Fix:**
✅ This is now automatically handled! The script waits for MySQL to be ready.

If you still see this error, wait 2 minutes and it should resolve.

### ❌ Services stuck in "Starting" after 30 minutes

**Problem:** Possible pod crash or resource issue

**Fix:**
```bash
# SSH to VM1
ssh appduser@<VM1-IP>

# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -A | grep -v Running

# Check specific pod logs
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>

# If needed, restart the service
appdcli stop <service-name>
appdcli start <service-name>
```

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

Use this to track your progress:

- [ ] AWS credentials configured
- [ ] Authentication verified (`aws sts get-caller-identity`)
- [ ] Repository cloned
- [ ] VPN connected (if required)
- [ ] Started deployment: `./deployment/01-deploy.sh --team N`
- [ ] Infrastructure created (~10 min)
- [ ] VMs bootstrapped (~20 min)
- [ ] Cluster created (~10 min)
- [ ] AppDynamics installed (~30 min)

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

### Check All Services Are Running

```bash
# From your laptop
ssh appduser@<VM1-IP>

# On VM1
appdcli ping

# All services should show "Success"
```

### Check Kubernetes Cluster

```bash
# On VM1
appdctl show cluster

# Should show 3 nodes, all "Running: true"
```

### Check Individual Services

```bash
# On VM1
kubectl get pods -A

# All pods should be "Running" with 1/1 or 2/2 ready
```

---

## 🧹 Cleanup (When Done)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Delete resources to avoid charges!

```bash
./deployment/cleanup.sh --team N --confirm
```

This removes:
- All EC2 instances
- Load balancer
- VPC and networking
- DNS records
- Elastic IPs

**Cost:** ~$20 per team per 8-hour day
